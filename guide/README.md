# Introduction

This guide will show you what Anti NSFW is as well as how to use Anti NSFW properly in your discord server.
Every command is listed here with a detailed description and a usage example.

## What is Anti NSFW?

Anti NSFW is a Discord Bot made by [Link#0069](https://top.gg/user/476662199872651264) that can be used to filter out NSFW content from your server.
It will scan all messages for NSFW content and delete any messages the AI thinks to be NSFW content.

## Why should I use Anti NSFW?

Discords filter is very poorly made and can even be bypassed by using stickers or emojis.
The filter never works and after the update the filter became very aggresive which causes it to filter messages that are not NSFW.

This is the reason I created Anti NSFW because I wanted to create a bot that filters out NSFW content properly.
Anti NSFW is supposed to be a better alternative to the Discord NSFW filter and it also provides more features than the Discord filter.
